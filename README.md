# QCC-Transformer

Query-Compiled Cache (QCC) Transformer is a PyTorch research prototype for long-context decoding. It keeps an exact recent window and compiles older tokens into a constant-size set of multi-timescale softmax responses.

This repository is an implementation of a falsifiable hypothesis, not a claim of a solved production system. The reference path uses Python sequence loops so that the state equations are easy to inspect. A useful next systems step is a fused Triton/CUDA update-and-read kernel.

## Why this is different

The archive does not store one K/V pair per historical token. For each KV head, it stores responses to a learned codebook of long-range queries under several exponential decay rates. At each decode step, only the exact local window is scanned; historical state is read in constant time with respect to context length.

The intended comparison is against full KV attention and sliding-window/GQA baselines. Related work includes linear attention, recurrent memory, KV eviction, KV quantization, MLA, and Infini-attention. The novelty boundary must be checked against those families before making a publication claim.

## Install

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

## Run tests

```bash
pytest
```

## Run the microbenchmark

```bash
python benchmarks/benchmark_decode.py --length 512 --warmup 1 --steps 3
```

The benchmark reports runtime only. It is not evidence of language-model quality. For a meaningful study, train matched small models and evaluate perplexity, Needle-in-a-Haystack, RULER, PG-19, cache memory, and decode TPOT at 32k+ context.

## Minimal API

```python
import torch
from qcc_transformer import QCCForCausalLM

model = QCCForCausalLM(
    vocab_size=32000,
    d_model=512,
    num_layers=8,
    num_heads=8,
    window_size=2048,
    num_codes=32,
)
input_ids = torch.randint(0, 32000, (1, 4096))
logits = model(input_ids)
```

## Caveats

The current reference implementation has three deliberate limitations: no RoPE, sequence-level Python loops, and a clipped exponential accumulator. These are appropriate for validating the architecture and its gradients, but not for production throughput. The archive state is accumulated in fp32 to reduce long-stream drift.
